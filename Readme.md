Build
=====

Maven
-----

This project uses maven. The project can be build by running the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```
After the command has run the final rainbow server jar can be found in `rainbow/target/Rainbow-<VERSION>.jar`.

IntelliJ
--------

I recommend using IntelliJ. It has good maven support and its integrated decompiler
 is very helpful for projects of this kind.

Before trying to import the project into the IDE I recommend building it from the
 command line the first time.
