Open the "runit.bat" file and customize the RAM setting and path to Java on your machine:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe" -Xmx4000m -Xincgc -jar Rainbow.jar
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Launch the jar using "_RunIt.bat"

If you get an error, check the path to Java and adjust accordingly. For example, you may find
it is located at C:\Program Files(x86)\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe

If you're using Linux, create a shell script equivalent. I use the following command on my Linux environments:
java -Xmx4000m -Xincgc -jar Rainbow.jar


However, here are some follow-up suggestions:

- When you first run the server, you'll need to agree to Mojang's EULA (eula.txt). So get that done.

- If your world is brand new, I suggest running the following which
  will clear a 16x16 area for designing your new spawn...
  If you are using an existing world, skip this part
  ---------------------------------------------------
  /spawn
  /diw skyclear 16
  /diw setgrass 16
  /diw border 16
  ---------------------------------------------------

can use /setworldspawn to change spawn location.

Note, the "server.properties" file defaults spawn protection to 16 radius.  Increase if desired.

Note: For new servers, note that the initial creation of chunks and region files cause a little lag.
That's normal and should go away after that's done once for each one. If you want to pre-create
a lot of such files before having players join, you can run the "/wild" teleport command to
load a lot up.


- To give players permissions to built-in rainbow features, you can do:
/diw script BasicPerms

- If you want to let players sell blocks to the server (i.e. "/sell hand"), then start by holding 
  a dirt block and do "/setworth 1".  Do the same for cobblestone. Customize further as you like. 

After comfortable, try out a plugin or two. I recommend 'RainbowKits' as your first since it's
simple to use and understand.  You can remove if you don't like but good practice.
